## 1. Background

This document presents a mini-project assessment intended to evaluate the technical and problem-solving capabilities of candidates applying for Full-Stack Engineering roles at 101 Digital PTE LTD.

### 1.1 Approach

Prior to commencing the mini-project, candidates must thoroughly review and understand the following:

- The mini-project requirements set out in this document.
- The assessment criteria outlined below.
- The deliverables required for submission to 101 Digital.

### 1.2 Overview

Candidates are required to design and develop a full-stack web application named **SimpleInvoice**.

The application must comprise:

- A **ReactJS frontend**.
- A **NestJS backend**.
- A database designed and implemented by the candidate.

No external third-party APIs are required for this project. Candidates are expected to develop and manage the complete application stack, including:

- Frontend layer.
- Backend layer.
- Database layer.

A mock dataset is provided in **Appendix A** to assist with database seeding and to provide guidance on the expected data structure and relationships.

---

## 2. Solution Requirements

## 2.1 SimpleInvoice Overview

The SimpleInvoice web application shall provide the following core features:

1. **Authentication** - Secure user authentication and access control.
2. **Invoice Listing** - A view displaying all available invoices within the system.
3. **Invoice Details** - A detailed view presenting information associated with an individual invoice.
4. **Invoice Creation** - Functionality enabling users to create and save new invoices.

---

### 2.1.1 Authentication Requirements

Candidates must implement a secure authentication mechanism that satisfies the following requirements:

- Provide a Login screen containing:
  - Email address input field.
  - Password input field.
- Implement appropriate client-side and server-side validation for all authentication inputs.
- Upon successful authentication, issue a **JSON Web Token (JWT)** and securely store the token on the client side for use in subsequent API requests.
- Restrict access to all protected application routes and resources.
- Users who are not authenticated must be automatically redirected to the Login screen.

> Note: The implementation of advanced password policies, such as complexity requirements, special character enforcement, password expiration, or multi-factor authentication, is not required as part of this assessment.

---

### 2.1.2 Invoice List / Home Screen

Upon successful authentication, users shall be directed to the Invoice List screen, which serves as the default landing page of the application.

#### Required Behavior

- Set this as the default home screen on successful login.
- Display a paginated list of invoices.
- The list must show the following key fields:
  - Invoice Number
  - Customer Name
  - Invoice Date
  - Due Date
  - Total Amount
  - Status / Invoice Status

#### List Management Features

The Invoice List must support the following data management capabilities:

##### Search

Users must be able to search invoices using either:

- Invoice Number
- Customer Name

Search functionality must support:

- Case-insensitive matching.
- Partial text matching.

##### Filter

Users must be able to filter invoices by the following status values:

- Draft
- Pending
- Paid
- Overdue

##### Sort

Users must be able to sort invoice records by any of the following fields:

- Invoice Date
- Due Date
- Total Amount

Sorting must support both:

- Ascending order.
- Descending order.

##### Pagination

- The invoice list must implement server-side pagination.
- The page size should be configurable.
- Pagination should support efficient retrieval of invoice records from the backend.

---

### 2.1.3 Invoice Detail

Users must be able to view the details of an individual invoice by selecting an invoice from the Invoice List screen.

Upon selection, the application shall navigate the user to the Invoice Details view.

The Invoice Details view must display comprehensive information relating to the selected invoice, including:

- Invoice information.
- Customer information.
- Invoice line items.
- Subtotal amount.
- Tax amount.
- Discount amount.
- Total invoice amount.
- Outstanding balance.
- Invoice status.

All invoice data presented in the detail view must accurately reflect the corresponding record stored in the system.

---

### 2.1.4 Create Invoice

#### Required Behavior

- Provide a screen/form to create a new invoice.
- Each invoice contains exactly **one line item** for this assessment.
- The data model may be designed to support multiple items in the future, but only one item needs to be implemented.
- New invoices must be created with status `Draft`.
- Invoice number is user-provided and must be unique.
- On successful creation:
  - Show a success notification.
  - Redirect to the Invoice List.
- Total amount must be calculated by the backend, not the frontend.

#### Required Fields and Validation Rules

| Field | Validation |
|---|---|
| Customer name | Required, non-empty string |
| Customer email | Required, valid email format |
| Customer mobile | Optional |
| Customer address | Optional |
| Invoice number | Required, unique |
| Invoice date | Required, valid date |
| Due date | Required, must be on or after invoice date |
| Currency | Required, for example `AUD`, `USD`, `GBP` |
| Item name | Required |
| Item quantity | Required, positive integer |
| Item rate | Required, positive number |
| Tax (%) | Non-negative number, defaults to `10%` |
| Discount | Optional, non-negative number, defaults to `0` |

---

## 2.2 Frontend Implementation Requirements

The frontend application must be implemented in **ReactJS** using **TypeScript**.

The following requirements must be adhered to:

- The application must be fully responsive and support both mobile and desktop viewports.
- Candidates may use any preferred styling approach or library, for example:
  - CSS
  - SCSS
  - styled-components
  - UI frameworks
- The use of widely adopted open-source libraries is permitted and encouraged where appropriate.
- The codebase must be clean, maintainable, and adequately documented to support readability and future maintenance.
- Unit testing is mandatory.
- While no minimum test coverage threshold is enforced, candidates are expected to provide tests for critical user flows and key UI components.

---

## 2.3 Backend Implementation Requirements

The backend service must be implemented using **NestJS** with **TypeScript**, and must expose a **RESTful API**.

The application must be supported by a relational database, with **PostgreSQL** recommended as the preferred database system.

The backend implementation should ensure a clean, modular architecture and support reliable data persistence and retrieval for all application features.

---

### 2.3.1 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---:|---|
| POST | `/auth/login` | No | Authenticate user, return JWT |
| GET | `/auth/me` | Yes | Return current authenticated user profile |
| GET | `/invoices` | Yes | List invoices with search, filter, sort, pagination |
| GET | `/invoices/:id` | Yes | Get invoice detail by ID |
| POST | `/invoices` | Yes | Create a new invoice |

#### Query Parameters for `GET /invoices`

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `page` | number | Page number, starting at `1` |
| `pageSize` | number | Records per page |
| `sortBy` | string | `invoiceDate`, `dueDate`, `totalAmount` |
| `ordering` | string | `ASC` or `DESC` |
| `status` | string | `Draft`, `Pending`, `Paid`, `Overdue` |
| `keyword` | string | Partial, case-insensitive search on invoice number or customer name |
| `fromDate` | string | Filter invoices on/after this date, format `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `toDate` | string | Filter invoices on/before this date, format `YYYY-MM-DD` |

#### Expected Response Shape for `GET /invoices`

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "paging": {
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 10,
    "total": 100
  }
}
```

---

### 2.3.2 Business Logic

Total amount calculation must be done on the server side.

```text
subTotal      = quantity * rate
taxAmount     = subTotal * (tax% / 100)
totalAmount   = subTotal + taxAmount - discount
balanceAmount = totalAmount - totalPaid
```

#### Business Rules

- Invoice numbers must be unique and enforced at the database level.
- Due date must be on or after invoice date and validated server-side.
- New invoices are always created with status `Draft`.

#### Overdue Status Behavior

`Overdue` is a derived status. It is not persisted in the database.

The backend computes it at read time:

```text
if status != "Paid" AND dueDate < today
  return status as "Overdue"
otherwise
  return the persisted status
```

The database stores only:

- Draft
- Pending
- Paid

`Overdue` is never written to the database.

---

### 2.3.3 Authentication & Authorization

The backend must implement authentication and authorization using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** to support stateless session management.

The following requirements apply:

- Authentication must be based on JWT access tokens.
- All `/invoices` API endpoints must be secured using a JWT authentication guard.
- Token expiration time must be configurable via an environment variable.
- If the token expiration time is not explicitly specified, it must default to `3600` seconds.
- At least one default user account must be seeded into the database for reviewer access.
- The corresponding credentials must be clearly documented in the project `README.md` file.

---

### 2.3.4 Data Seeding

The backend must include a database seed script responsible for populating the system with sample invoice data.

The following requirements apply:

- A seed script must be provided to populate the database with initial dataset entries.
- The mock dataset provided in **Appendix A** must be used as the foundation for seed data structure and relationships.
- Additional invoice records, approximately **20-50 entries**, must be generated to ensure sufficient data variability for testing.
- Generated records must include a diverse range of:
  - Invoice statuses.
  - Invoice dates.
  - Due dates.
  - Total amounts.
- This is to ensure that key features such as search, filtering, sorting, and pagination can be effectively demonstrated and evaluated.
- The seed script must be runnable with a single command:

```bash
npm run seed
```

---

### 2.3.5 Input Validation

- Use `class-validator` and `class-transformer` through NestJS `ValidationPipe` on all endpoints.
- Return clear, structured validation error responses.

Example validation error response:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": ["dueDate must be on or after invoiceDate"],
  "error": "Bad Request"
}
```

---

### 2.3.6 Error Handling

- Implement a global exception filter returning consistent error responses.

Example error response:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 404,
  "message": "Invoice not found",
  "error": "Not Found"
}
```

---

### 2.3.7 Testing Requirements

Unit testing is mandatory for the backend implementation.

While no minimum test coverage threshold is enforced, candidates are expected to ensure adequate coverage of core functionality.

The following requirements must be satisfied:

- Unit tests must be implemented for the backend application.
- Critical business logic must be covered by tests, including:
  - Invoice total calculations.
  - Overdue status derivation.
  - Due date validation logic.
  - Enforcement of unique invoice numbers.
- At least one integration or end-to-end test must be implemented, covering a complete key workflow.

Example workflow:

- Creating an invoice.
- Verifying its appearance in the invoice list.

---

### 2.3.8 API Documentation

The backend API must be documented using Swagger/OpenAPI, generated via the `@nestjs/swagger` package.

The following requirements apply:

- API documentation must be automatically generated using `@nestjs/swagger`.
- The Swagger UI must be available at `/api/docs` when the application is running.
- All API endpoints must be fully documented, including:
  - Request payloads.
  - Query parameters.
  - Response schemas and status codes.

---

## 2.4 Architecture Requirements

### 2.4.1 Project Structure

Organize your project as a monorepo or two separate repositories. Either is acceptable, but the choice must be documented in the `README.md`.

Suggested monorepo structure:

```text
simple-invoice/
├── frontend/                # ReactJS app
│   ├── src/
│   └── ...
├── backend/                 # NestJS API
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── invoices/
│   │   ├── database/
│   │   │   └── seed/
│   │   └── common/
│   └── ...
├── docker-compose.yml
└── README.md
```

---

### 2.4.2 Containerization

- Provide a `docker-compose.yml` that starts the frontend, backend, and database with a single command.

Modern Docker:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Legacy Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Additional requirements:

- Each service must have its own Dockerfile.
- Document all exposed ports in the `README.md`.

---

### 2.4.3 Environment Configuration

The application must support environment-based configuration using `.env` files for all environment-specific settings.

The following requirements apply:

- All environment-specific configuration values must be managed via `.env` files, including:
  - Database connection strings.
  - JWT secrets.
  - Application ports.
- A `.env.example` file must be provided, containing all required configuration keys without any real or sensitive values.
- All secrets, credentials, and configuration parameters must be sourced exclusively from environment variables.
- Hardcoding of sensitive information within the codebase is strictly prohibited.

# Appendix A - Mock Dataset

Use the following as the basis for the seed script.

The `quantity` field is an integer. The unit of measure is not part of the data model.

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "createdAt": "2026-06-03T12:03:26.995",
      "createdBy": "ad1e0902-1928-4345-b513-60c86c94fc91",
      "currency": "AUD",
      "currencySymbol": "AU$",
      "customer": {
        "fullname": "Paul",
        "address": "Singapore",
        "email": "paul@101digital.io",
        "mobileNumber": "947717364111"
      },
      "description": "Invoice is issued to Kanglee",
      "dueDate": "2026-07-03",
      "invoiceDate": "2026-06-03",
      "invoiceId": "099ca7da-a290-40fa-93b9-1c43ae7bb887",
      "invoiceNumber": "IV1780488206995",
      "invoiceSubTotal": 2000.00,
      "totalDiscount": 20.00,
      "totalTax": 200.00,
      "totalAmount": 2180.00,
      "totalPaid": 1451.34,
      "balanceAmount": 728.66,
      "items": [
        {
          "id": "b1c2d3e4-0000-0000-0000-000000000001",
          "name": "Honda RC150",
          "quantity": 2,
          "rate": 1000
        }
      ],
      "invoiceReference": "#5721662",
      "status": "Overdue",
      "type": "INVOICE",
      "invoiceGrossTotal": 2000.00
    }
  ],
  "paging": {
    "pageNumber": 1,
    "pageSize": 10,
    "totalRecords": 94980
  }
}
```

## Seed Guidance

Generate **20-50 additional records** with a mix of:

- Statuses:
  - Draft
  - Pending
  - Paid
- Varied invoice dates.
- Varied due dates.
- Varied amounts.
- Varied customer names.

This ensures that all list management features are meaningful to test:

- Search.
- Filter.
- Sort.
- Pagination.

Do not seed `Overdue` as a stored status. It must be derived automatically.
